Codejail service
================

|ci-badge| |license-badge|

The repository codejailservice manages execution of untrusted code in secure sandboxes. It is designed primarily for Python execution, but
can be used for other languages as well. The security is enforced with AppArmor.

The creation of Codejail service affects the way untrusted code is executed, because it runs in a separate
container from the one running the platform.
